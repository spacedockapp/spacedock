        <Title>Flagship</Title>
        <Unique>Y</Unique>
        <Ability>1) Players receive a set of 4 flagship cards (with 2 options on each card) and choose 1 of those options to use during the tournament. There are 4 Independent options and 1 option for each faction: Federation, Klingon, Romulan, and Dominion. If a Federation, Klingon, Romulan, or Dominion flagship option is chosen, players must assign a ship of the same faction as their flagship. If an Independent option is chosen, players may assign any ship as their flagship and pay no faction penalty. An independent faction flagship is now independent faction in addition to its original faction.

2) Flagship cards are oversized cards that are placed beneath your ship card. These cards will have additional stats that increase the printed values* of your ship (primary weapon, agility, hull, shields). In addition, flagship cards may add bonus text-based abilities, actions, and upgrade slots to the assigned ship card.

3) Players may use the bonus text-based ability in addition to their ship's normal text-based ability (if applicable) during the battle.

4) If a ship card does not have the bonus action in its action bar, that ship is now considered to have that action in its action bar. If a ship card already has the bonus action in its action bar, that ship may use this action as a free action every round.

5) If there is a bonus (talent) upgrade slot on your chosen flagship option, you may choose a (talent) upgrade even if your captain does not have the (talent) icon on the captain card. This talent is considered to be attached to the captain.

6) Players also receive a special plastic base and pegs that will show which ship is your flagship at a glance. The color of the base and pegs is black.

        <Ability>1. Players may only include 1 Attack Squadron when building their fleets for the tournament. This counts as their one resource for the tournament. Each Attack Squadron is comprised of one pre-painted miniature, a plastic base, two pegs, Ship Token, Maneuver Dial, Ship Card, A Maneuver Reference Card, 4 Attack Squadron tokens, two Attack Squadron ID tokens, and Shield Tokens (if applicable).

2. Attack Squadrons are treated as normal ships with the following exceptions:

a. Attack Squadrons can only attack enemy ships at a range 1-2.

b. Attack Squadrons can not be equipped with any upgrades or captain cards.

c. Each Attack Squadron Token has Primary Weapon, Agility, Hull, and Shield values, as well as a Captain Skill number on them. The Attack Squadron tokens are placed in a stack on top of the ship's card in descending order (from highest to lowest) of their Captain Skill values. NOTE: The value listed on the token at the top of the stack are always considered the Attack Squadron's current abilities and Captain Skill.

d. When an Attack Squadron sustains damage to its Hull, do not draw The Damage Cards as normal. Instead, remove one token from the top of the stack. Tokens removed in this way are removed from the game and may not be restored. Once there are no tokens left in the stack, the Attack Squadron is destroyed. Note: Only 1 Attack Squadron token may be removed by any single attack, regardless of how much damage is dealt by the attack.

e. If an Attack Squadron has Shields, the Shields are fully repaired and activated every time a new Attack Squadron token is revealed.

f. All critical damage sustained by an Attack Squadron is immediately converted into normal damage.

3) Officer Cards add bonus text-based abilities and Upgrade Slots to the assigned [CREW] Upgrade and/or his ship. Players may use the bonus text-based abilities in addition to their [CREW] Upgrade's normal text-based ability (if applicable) during the Battle.

4) The First Officer Card has an [ELITE TALENT] icon at the bottom of the card. This allows the First Officer's ship to field 1 [ELITE TALENT] Upgrade as though the First Officer were a Captain. This [ELITE TALENT] Upgrade is in addition to any [ELITE TALENT] Upgrade(s) that your ship's Captain can field.

5) If a [CREW] Upgrade that has one or more Officer Cards assigned to it is ever disabled, its assigned Officer Card(s) are considered disabled as well.

However, before executing a Spin Maneuver, the player rotates their ship 90°. In order to rotate a ship, place a [1 STRAIGHT] Maneuver Template touching the side of the ship's base with the top edge of the template even with the front eedge of the ship base (as shown in A below).

Then, rotate the ship 90° (either right or left depending on the selected maneuver) so that the top edge of the [1 STRAIGHT] maneuver template is even with the side of the ship base (as shown in B below).

After rotating the ship, complete the selected maneuver as normal using the appropriate maneuver template.</Ability>

            <Title>Initiative</Title>
            <Ability>Ships have initiative, a distinction used to resolve timing conflicts involving Captains of equal Skill. The ships belonging to the player with the LOWEST point total at the start of the game always have initiative. The next lowest point total have initiative, and so on. If two or more players' squadron point totals are equal at the start of the game, then use the ship's Faction to determine the order of initiative as follows:

    Federation
    Klingon
    Romulan
    Dominion
    Borg
    Species 8472
    Kazon
    Bajoran
    Ferengi
    Vulcan
    Independent
    Mirror Universe

Initiative does not change during the game. During the Activation Phase, when ships of equal Captain Skill are activated, the ship with initiative activates first. Then the next ship in initiative order that has the same Captain Skill activates, and so on.

Initiative also applies during the Combat Phase; the ship with initiative resolves its combat steps BEFORE an opponent's ship with the same Captain Skill (see "Simultaneous Attack Rule").

If a single place owns multiple ships from the same Faction with the same Captain Skill, he may activate those ships and resolve their attacks in the order of his choosing.

It may be possible for different players to have ships from the same Faction with the same Captain Skill. When this occurs, determine randomly at the start of the game which of those ships will have initiative over the others throughout the game.</Ability>

Any [HIT] or [CRITICAL] damages the target ship as normal.

Ships may roll defense dice against this damage using their ship's printed Agility value.</Ability>

        <Title>Energy Web Token (EWT)</Title>
        <Ability>The EWTs are double-sided, with a gold border on one side. If both fleets are using EWTs, one fleet places the gold border side face up and the other fleet places the non-gold border side face up.

Once you place an EWT in the play area, it will remain there until the end of the battle unless your last Tholian ship is destroyed, in which case all of your EWTs are immediately removed from the play area.

GUIDE TOKENS
Guide Tokens are used to place new EWTs in the play area. A Guide Token will remain adjacent to the rear of a Tholian Ship for one full turn after performing an Energy Web Action, including during movement. If the Tholian Ship does not perform an Energy Web Action on the following turn, then the Guide Token is removed from beside the ship. While the Guide Token is adjacent to a Tholian Ship, it is considered an EWT for purposes of damaging and obstructing enemy ships (see below).

ENERGY WEB
EWTs are treated as Obstacles but do not inflict normal Obstacle damage.

A ship whose base or Maneuver Template overlaps an EWT, or a ship that has an EWT placed on top of it, must roll 1 attack die for every 2 EWTs in that you have in the play area, rounded up (max 10 dice.). Any [HIT] or [CRIT] damages the target ship as normal. The affected ship does not roll any defense dice.

NOTE: Tholian ships are immune to the effects of EWTs and may move and/or fire through them without penalty.

To place an EWT after performing an Energy Web Action, follow these steps:

1) After performing a 1 [STRAIGHT] Maneuver, place a Guide Token (or slide an existing Guide Token Forward) so that the side of the Guide Token with the arrow pointing toward it touches and lines up with the back edge of your ship's base.

2) Place an EWT so that the end of the EWT touches the back of the Guide Token and lines up with the beam line on the Guide Token.

3) After you place the EWT, you may change the facing of your ship. If you choose to do so, place a 2nd Guide Token (be sure that the arrow is pointing away from the EWT). NOTE: When changing your facing, you may place the 2nd Guide Token to the right or left of the existing Guide Token.

4) Move your ship so that the back edge of the ship's base touches and lines up with the edge of the new Guide Token. Then remove the first Guide Token.</Ability>

        <Title>Grapple Token</Title>
        <Ability>Each ship cable of performing the Grappler Action can maintain only 1 Grapple at a time (i.e. Each ship can only have 1 blue Grapple Token assigned to it.)
While a ship has a Red Grapple Token assigned to it, that ship follows these special rules:

1) When attacking, the ship rolls 1 less attack dice. Each time the ship defends, it rolls 1 less defense die.

2) During the Planning Phase, the ship's owner cannot select a Speed greater then 2.

3) At the end of the Activation Phase, if the grappled ship is no longer within Range 1 of the grappling ship, then remove the corresponding Red and Blue Grapple tokens from beside both ships.

4) During the Combat Phase, a grappled ship may forego its attack, and roll a number of attack dice equal to its Primary Weapon Value. If that ship rolls at least 2 [HIT] or [CRIT] results, remove the corresponding Red and Blue Grapple Tokens from beside both ships. This roll cannot be modified.</Ability>

        <Title>Borg Shield Matrix Token (BSMT)</Title>
        <Type>Token</Type>
        <Ability>A ship with at least 1 BSMT on its Borg Shield Matrix upgrade gfollows these Special rules:

1) Each time you defend, roll +1 defense die for every BSMT on your Borg Shield Matrix Upgrade (+3 dice max).

2) Whenever an enemy ship attempts to affect your Captain or 1 of your Upgrades, roll 1 attack die for each BSMT on your Borg Shield Matrix Upgrade. If you roll at least 1 [HIT] or [CRIT] result, the attempt fails and your Captain or Upgrade is unaffected. Note: If the attempt required 1 or more of the initiating ship's cards to be disabled or discarded in order to make the attempt, those cards are still disabled or discarded, even if the attempt failed.

If your Borg Shield Matrix Upgrade is disabled, you do not gain the above special abilities.
If you Borg Shield Matrix Upgrade is discarded, discard all the BSMT on it as well. Borg Shiel Matrix Tokens cannot otherwise be removed from your Borg Shield Matrix Upgrade Card once they are placed.</Ability>

        <Title>Escape Pod Token (EPT)</Title>
        <Type>Token</Type>
        <Ability>While an Escape Pod Token is in the play area:

1) During the Activation Phase, after all ships have moved, the Escape Pod must move 1 [FORWARD] in the direction of the arrow on the Token.  If it overlaps a friendly ship's base after this move, it is considered to be picked up by the ship (see below).  If it overlaps an enemy ship's base after its move, it is destroyed.

2) During the Combat Phase, it cannot attack, but it may be attacked.  It has 0 Agility, a Hull Value of 1, and 0 Shields.

3) The cards beneath the "Escape Pod" Upgrade card cannot use their text abilities and cannot be affected by enemy Upgrades.

If a friendly ship is within Range 1 of an EPT at the end of the Activation Phase (or it is placed directly on a friendly ship's base), the EPT is considered picked up.  Remove the EPT from the game and discard the "Escape Pod" Upgrade Card.  Place all of the cards beneath it beside that ship's cards.  These cards are now considered to be deployed to that ship.

NOTE: The [CREW] Upgrade cards may exceed the ship's restrictions, but there may only be 1 Captain Card assigned to the ship.  You may keep either your original Captain card or the one from the Escape Pod and remove the other one from the game.</Ability>

        <Title>Time Token</Title>
        <Type>Token</Type>
        <Ability>Many Upgrades instruct a player to place a certain number of Time Tokens on them. The player places that many Time Tokens on the Upgrade and cannot activate that Upgrade again until after all of its Time Tokens have expired. During the End Phase, the player removes 1 Time Token from each of his Upgrades.
        
For example, a ship that uses a Photon Torpedoes Upgrade places 3 Time Tokens on it. This means that the ship will not be able to initiate that attack until after all of the Time Tokens have been removed.</Ability>

        <Title>Continuous Effect Token (CET)</Title>
        <Type>Token</Type>
        <Ability>Many Upgrades feature Continuous Effects, which are tracked through the use of Continuous Effect Tokens (CETs). CETs bear the same name as their corresponding Upgrade Cards (on the back). Some Continuous Effects are beneficial (featuring a green bordered CET) and others are detrimental (featuring a red bordered CET).

During Set-Up, players place all of their Upgrades' CETs on top of their corresponding Upgrade Cards so that they are always near at hand. When a Continuous Effect is activated, the corresponding CET(s) are placed in the play area beside the Effect's recipient(s).

Whenever an Upgrade with a Continuous Effect instructs a player to place Time Tokens on it, the Continuous Effect begins. If the Upgrade does not specify the recipient of the Continuous Effect, then the Continuous Effect affects the owner.

During the End Phase (or at any other time), if an Upgrade loses its last Time Token, the Continuous Effect ends and the corresponding CET(s) are removed from the play area and placed back on top of their corresponding Upgrade Card.

If a CET is ever removed from the play area prematurely due to a special ability, then the Effect ends immediately and the CET is returned to its Upgrade Card. Any remaining Time Tokens stay on the Upgrade Card, however, prohibiting the ship from activating the Upgrade again until after the Time Tokens expire.

SPECIAL RULE FOR CONTINUOUS EFFECTS:
If an upgrade with Time Tokens is disabled or discarded, then its Time Tokens remain on the card and any of its Continuous Effects that were already active remain in effect until the duration expires. This also applies to Upgrades belonging to a destroyed ship.

PERMANENT EFFECT TOKEN: Some Upgrades instruct a player to place a Permanent Effect Token on them. A Permanent Effect Token has a purple border and is not removed during the End Phase.
